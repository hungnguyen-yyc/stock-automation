My brain dump for a trading signal system.
The idea is to collect data points then look for swing highs and lows to form levels.
It then will check for if the current price is touching one of those level.
The signal creates when the follow up candle determines the direction after the signal, also volumes will be considered in the signal as well.

IBKR Apis being used as an feature for automating trades (paper).

TODO:
- Improve to make price action signals (create trendlines, detect patterns, etc.)
